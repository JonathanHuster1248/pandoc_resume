Education
---------

2020-2022 
:   **MS, Energy Resources Engineering**; Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA)

    *Thesis: Carbon Abatement Cost Curves for Power Generation in the United States*

2014-2018
:   **BA, Physics**; Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO)

Experience
----------

**Senior Software Engineer - Ascend Analytics**

Worked on a team of 7 engineers creating sustainable scalable backend products. 
Focused on areas of data engineering, modeling, containerization, and Testing:

* Designed and implemented model improvements that decreased model run time by 40%

* Trained a dozen non-technical team memebers to use cloud resources for a 60% cost reduction 

* Utilized Terraform to create containerized apps and batch pools in Azure

* Dockerized sub-modules enabliung runs on Azure Infrastructure for scalability and repeatability

* Assisted in migrating file systems to blob from on prem. resources for security, accessibility, and ease of use


**Summer Intern - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission**

I built tools to enpower non-technical collaborators to explore data and identify anomolous behavior 

* Created Power-BI dashboard with SQL and Pandas to enpower non-technical individuals to explore millions of data points 

* Utilized SciKitLearn to identify anomolous decision making on unuspervised data 

**Research Associate - JGCRI (Pacific Northwest National Lab)**

Contributed to open source code to address reseach questions at the intersection of economics and energy.

* Presented research to dozens of technical and non-technical collaborators at open conference highlighting the impact of the work

* Identified and built naratives quantifying and communicating impacts from data and model results

* Formatted, aggregated, and synthesized data (~1,000,000 rows) using R's Tidyverse package

Technical Experience
--------------------

[League Predictor](https://github.com/JonathanHuster1248/LeaguePredictor)
:   We have created a simple win/lose prediction model for the game League of Legends. This model pulls data from Riot's API, formats the data into a dataframe, and creates a deep neural network which trains off of historical game data to forecast the winner of a game given only a snippet of the game's data. 

    * Include tools like pytest, unittest, and CI/CD automations

Arjan Codes
: I have recieved a certificate from [Arjan Codes](https://www.arjancodes.com/) for the completion of his Software Designer Mindset. I learned the fundamentals of software designing and planning ranging from tool set up in VS Code, simple CI/CD pipelines, and design practices in minimizing coupling and maximizing cohesion. 

[Downpayment vs Investment Calculator](https://github.com/JonathanHuster1248/home_v_stock)
: I have created a simple dashboard to compare the decision between saving for (and purchasing) a 
home compared to renting and investing the money that would have gone to a down payment.  


Programming Languages
:   **Python:** I have focused on data modeling in Python, using libraries like **Pandas** and 
**Numpy**. We have also utilized **pytest** and **unittest** to validate our model's behavior. 
As the team has moved from local development to focusing on cloud based resources I have also 
intereacted with **fsspec** and **Azure** access data stored on Azure's blob systems and utilized Docker 
to standardize and scale code usage with batch jobs and container apps on Azure resources. 

:   **R:** The model system at JGCRI focused on data manipulation with **Tidyverse** and visualtization with **ggplot**. I have experience pipelining data to 
synthesize results from large quantities and sources of data and establising a narative from those results.
