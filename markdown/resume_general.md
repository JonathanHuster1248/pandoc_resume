Technical Experience
--------------------

Arjan Codes
: I earned a certificate from [Arjan Codes](https://www.arjancodes.com/) for the completion of his Software Designer Mindset. I learned about pytest and unit-tests, simple CI/CD pipelines, and design practices in minimizing coupling and maximizing cohesion. 


Programming Languages
:   **Python:** I have focused on data modeling, using libraries like Pandas and 
Numpy. I have used pytest and unittest to validate behavior intereacted with Azure's blob systems 
and utilized Docker to standardize and scale code usage with batch jobs and container apps on Azure.
